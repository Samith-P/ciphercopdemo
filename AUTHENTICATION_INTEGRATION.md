# Authentication Integration Test Plan

## What we've implemented:

1. **AuthContext**: Centralized authentication state management
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Auth status checking
   - User information storage

2. **ProtectedRoute**: Route protection component
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
   - Shows loading state during auth check
   - Preserves intended destination

3. **Updated Login/Signup**: 
   - Integrated with AuthContext
   - Error handling
   - Proper redirects after authentication

4. **Updated Home**: 
   - User info display
   - Logout functionality
   - Protected by ProtectedRoute

5. **Backend Protection**:
   - Added protectRoute middleware to phishing API endpoints
   - Existing auth endpoints remain unchanged

## Testing Steps:

1. Start backend server (port 5001)
2. Start frontend (port 5173)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
4. Should redirect to /login automatically
5. Try to access /home directly - should redirect to login
6. Login with valid credentials
7. Should redirect to home page
8. Try using phishing detection feature
9. Should work with authentication
10. Logout should redirect to login page

## Current Status:
- ✅ Authentication flow implemented
- ✅ Route protection added
- ✅ Backend endpoints protected
- ⚠️ Clone detection service (port 5000) not yet protected
- ⚠️ Malware and Scam pages don't make backend calls yet

## Next Steps if needed:
- Protect clone detection service endpoints
- Add authentication to any future malware/scam backend endpoints

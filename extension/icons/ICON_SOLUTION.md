# Icon Creation Solution

Since the extension failed to load due to missing icon files, I've removed the icon references from the manifest.json file.

## Current Status âœ…
- Extension will now load properly without icon errors
- Chrome will use default extension icon placeholder
- All functionality remains intact

## Adding Icons Later (Optional)

If you want to add custom icons later, you can:

### Method 1: Simple Online Creation
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Create a simple shield design with "CC" text
3. Download all sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)
4. Save them in the `icons/` folder
5. Add the icon references back to manifest.json

### Method 2: Use Any PNG Files
1. Find any PNG files and rename them to:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
2. Place them in the `icons/` folder
3. Add the icon references back to manifest.json

### Adding Icons Back to Manifest
When you have the icon files, add this to manifest.json:

```json
"action": {
  "default_popup": "popup/popup.html",
  "default_title": "CipherCop Security Scanner",
  "default_icon": {
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "32": "icons/icon32.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon128.png"
  }
},
"icons": {
  "16": "icons/icon16.png",
  "32": "icons/icon32.png",
  "48": "icons/icon48.png",
  "128": "icons/icon128.png"
}
```

## Current Solution
The extension is now ready to install and will work perfectly with Chrome's default icon placeholder. The functionality is not affected by the missing custom icons.

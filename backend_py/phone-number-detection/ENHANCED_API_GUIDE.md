# Enhanced Phone Scam Detection APIs

## Current Issue Analysis
Your current APIs are providing basic phone validation, not scam detection:

1. **IPQS**: Good fraud score (0) but requires Enterprise L4+ for detailed analysis
2. **Twilio**: Error 60600 - Caller name lookup needs premium subscription
3. **Telesign**: 401 error - Invalid API key or expired account
4. **Numverify**: Basic validation only, no fraud detection

## Better Scam Detection APIs

### 1. TrueCaller Business API ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Best for spam detection**
- Real spam scores from millions of users
- Categories: Telemarketing, Scam, Fraud, etc.

- Cost: Premium but very effective

### 2. Hiya Business API ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Professional spam/scam detection
- Used by major telecom carriers
- Real-time reputation scoring
- API: https://www.hiya.com/business

### 3. Community Databases (FREE) ⭐⭐⭐

### 4. PhoneValidator.com ⭐⭐⭐

## Enhanced System Architecture

```
Phone Number → Multiple APIs → Scam Score Aggregation → Verdict

Current Flow:
Number → Validation APIs → Basic Check → "Appears Legitimate"

Enhanced Flow:
Number → Scam Databases → Reputation APIs → Risk Score → "LIKELY SCAM" / "SUSPICIOUS"
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Add free community databases
2. **Short-term**: Fix Telesign authentication
3. **Long-term**: Integrate TrueCaller or Hiya for professional scam detection
